Custom Train Alerts for NJT Trains
==================================

A ruby script that pulls in the current NJT Trains RSS xml and determines if there is a new alert for a train I normal ride or care about during my work commute.  If there is an alert about one or more of the trains, the script will send me an email.

During the normal work week, the script is run every 15 minutes during a 3 hour window in the morning and afternoon.
